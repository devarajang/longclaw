ISO Socket Stress Test Tool

A high-performance stress testing tool designed to generate ISO8583-style socket traffic against any TCP/TLS server. The tool is optimized for fintech systems that rely on ISO message formats and need predictable, reproducible load patterns.

🚀 Features

TCP / TLS (SSL) socket communication

Parallel workers (goroutine-based)

Configurable Requests Per Second (RPS)

Optional client certificate authentication

Full request/response logging

Round-trip latency measurement

Safe concurrency using channels

Metrics aggregation (success/failure counts, latency, throughput)

This tool is ideal for:

Load testing issuer/acquirer simulators

Benchmarking ISO8583 switch performance

Testing socket-based fintech systems

TLS handshake, certificate validation, and connection reuse behavior
